## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#34495E), reminiscent of the night sky, creating a calming and mystical atmosphere.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), providing a sophisticated, high-contrast backdrop that enhances the visibility of celestial elements.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700), used sparingly to highlight important information and add a touch of cosmic elegance, mirroring the brilliance of stars.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, which will serve well in headlines also.
- Sanskrit portions: 'Literata', a transitional serif with a literary feel
- Use celestial-themed icons, such as constellations, stars, and lunar phases, to represent Nakshatras and related concepts.
- Subtle animations, such as twinkling stars or a slowly rotating Earth, to add visual interest without overwhelming the user.
